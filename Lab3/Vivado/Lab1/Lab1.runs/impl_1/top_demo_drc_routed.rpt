2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net smol_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin FSM_sequential_CURRENT_STATE[1]_i_3/O, cell FSM_sequential_CURRENT_STATE[1]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT FSM_sequential_CURRENT_STATE[1]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
driver/FSM_sequential_CURRENT_STATE_reg[0]
driver/FSM_sequential_CURRENT_STATE_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
