This repository is broken down into each laboratory and should be
cloned on your desktop.  It contains System Verilog, testbenches,
documents relevant to each laboratory, and a template to start working
on your Digital System Development Board (DSDB) by National
Instruments.  More information about the board can be found here:
https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/digital-systems-development-specs/resource/376641b.pdf
and in this repository.

The DSDB device was designed by Xilinx, but manufactured by a company
called Digilent.  There is some other information availble at
Digilent's <a href="https://digilent.com/reference/dsdb/dsdb">here</a>.
